-- Concepts explored are JOIN and UNION I have learnt.

-- JOIN
--- INNDER JOIN - returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables

###
SELECT *
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN customers c
ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;

Orders      Customers
[1,2,3]    [2,3,4]

INNER JOIN: [2,3]  ‚Üê only matching IDs
###

--- LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN) - RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN) is similar but flipped
###
SELECT *
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN customers c
ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;

Orders      Customers
[1,2,3]  sa
LEFT JOIN: [1(NULL), 2, 3]
###

--- FULL JOIN - Returns all rows from both tables, with NULLs where no mathces exists

-- UNION
