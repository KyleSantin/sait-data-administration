# Networking Essentials

## Overview
MAC address and network topology types, OSI and TCP/IP models

## Key Topics Covered
**MAC Address** - What it is, how to find it through command prompt, byte relation to manufacturer and vendor, 
**Types of Network Topologies** - Star, Mesh, Ring, Bus, their advantages and disadvantages
**OSI and TCP/IP models** - The layers each protocol has and the similarities between the two

## Key Takeaway
- MAC addresses are stamped on every NIC created with the first 6 bytes being assigned by IEEE and the remainder 6 bytes are assigned by the manufacturer.
- Certain types of topologies create more secure networks at the cost of price and redundancy.
- OSI and TCP/IP understanding is crucial to network fundamentals and how data is transferred throughout networks.

## Reflection
- When creating project topologies I'll have to consider mixed network topologies while keeping in mind cost effectiveness.
- The OSI and TCP/IP models require further study to ensure it's full understanding with how important it is to the fundamentals of networking.
