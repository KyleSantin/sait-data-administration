# Networking Essentials

**Flash Cards** for the days lesson: [Flashcards](https://www.revisely.com/flashcards/decks/x8gXxI)

## Overview
Exploring "LAN" vs "WAN" vs "PAN", Routers, Switches, HUBs, and different cable types

## Key Topics Covered
**LAN, WAN, PAN** - speeds, scope, latency differences, purpose
**Network Devices** - Routers, Switches, Hubs (why they are obsolete)
**Cables** - Differences between Cat5e, Cat6, RG-6, RG-8, coaxial history, optic fiber advantages
**Hands-on Tasks** - Terminating RJ-45 twisted pair
**Best Practice** - Cable management and why we prevent cable bends

## Key Takeaway
- Understanding the different use cases for network types given the geographic scope needing to be covered
- The function of network devices and their evolution

## Reflection
I have a better understanding of network devices and their place within a topology and how they play a role in network types
