Procedure
# Navigate the Active Directory Users and Computers, create users, edit permissions, enable file sharing and access
them through inherited permissions.

Key Takeaway
# The amount of user, group, global, and inherited permissions that can be controlled is robust. A good understanding of
navigation through these features will be a great asset to troubleshooting user issues when access is not permitted or
ensuring new users are given the correct permissions to prevent inital issues in regard to permission access.
