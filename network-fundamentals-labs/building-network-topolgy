Procedure
# Create a network topology that would support 10 employees within an office setting. Create, connect, and assign devices
within the network and explain the advantages and disadvantages the network may face.

# I created a combination of mesh and star topology with workstations and switches connected through a mesh are found
on two different office floors and are connected by a router. This creates a star topology between switches and router
connecting both floors of the office.

MESH
# Advantages: Mesh topology with end devices and switches makes it easy to troubleshoot failures in the network as well
as keeping the network up for the majority of the connected devices. Connecting two switches together ensures there is 
no single failure in the network at this level and allows traffic to continue transmitting to the router.

# Disadvantages: Scalability and cost with a Mesh Topology is difficult as the network grows.

STAR
# Advantages: It is easy to setup and locate faults within the network. Scalability is easily handled by adding the 
necessary devices to the router.

# Disadvantages: Network uptime is not as strong as a mesh topology as it has a single failure point (router).
