Procedure
# Capture a network packet and analyze the contents. Use the OSI model and explain your findings
1. Capture a Hello-Client packet and match each section with the OSI model.
2. Identify each section of the capture and explain how they are in reference to each section of a 
frame/packet/segment and document your findings

Key Takeaway
1. Using Wireshark's filter is an easy way to locate the packet you are analyzing. ie: _ws.col.info contains "Client Hello"
2. Each layer of the capture easily identifies the sections that make up the frame/packet/segment.
3. I can see how you would apply this to identifying network traffic 
(long frame durations, unauthorized frames, bottlenecks with slow performance).
