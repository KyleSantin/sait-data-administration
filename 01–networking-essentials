Flash Cards for the days lesson: [Flashcards](https://www.revisely.com/flashcards/decks/x8gXxI)

### Task 1: Network Basics

1. Network Types:

[Research and explain the differences between LAN (Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network), and MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)]

[LAN - Local Area Network]
- Localized geographic areas like office buildings that provide high-speed, low-latency connections

[MAN - Metropolitan Area Network]
- Spanning larger regions connecting multiple LANs in public regions like universities and several office buildings.

[WAN - Wide Area Network]
- Spanning boarder regions connecting multiple LAN's over long distances, slow-speed, high-latency connections.

2. Network Components:

[Describe the roles of the following components]

[Router: How does it route data between networks]
A router is used to route network traffic between networks, be it multiple LANs and WAN networks.

[Switch: How does it forward data within a network]
By establishing direct communication and reducing congestion through specific topologies and policies by using it's MAC Address Table.

[Hub: What is its function, and why is it less commonly used today]
Used to connect multiple devices to share data. A switch and router have taken it's place with more effective results.

### Task 2: Cabling and Physical Connectivity

1. Cable Types:

[Compare and contrast the following cable types]

[Twisted-Pair Cable (Cat-5e, Cat-6): Discuss their use in Ethernet networks]
- Cat-5e - Most common and sufficent for home and small business networks. A cheaper and flexible option for quick installations.
- Cat-6 - tighter twisted pairs and some have the addition of a plastic spine in the center to improve the negation 
of crosstalk and electromagnetic interference. Best suited for enterprise networks and heavier data transfers. 
Not as flexible as Cat-5e and more expensive.

[Coaxial Cable (RG-6, RG-8): Explain their historical significance]
- RG-6 - Was commonly used to connect satellite dishes to TVs
- RG-8 - Was the original cable for internet connections along side bus topologies
[Fiber-Optic Cable: Highlight its advantages and applications]
- Advantages are high bandwidth, secure communication, and resistant to environmental factors such as electromagnetic interference

2. Cable Installation:

[Provide step-by-step instructions for installing twisted-pair cables (e.g., terminating
RJ-45 connectors)]
Step 1. Cut the jacket to expose the cables
Step 2. Separate and pair them accordingly
Step 3. Insert them into the RJ-45 connector
Step 4. Crimp the cables and RJ-45 connector to complete the cable

[Explain the importance of cable management and avoiding cable bends]
- Cable bends can damage the internal cables preventing them from proper data transfering.
- Keeping your cables organized can assist in time management when troubleshooting while offering a visually professional workstation.
