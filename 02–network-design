## Network Interface and Models

Flash cards for the days lesson: https://www.revisely.com/flashcards/decks/R1FKUj

Scavenger Hunt Items:

1. MAC Address

# Find the MAC address of your computer or smartphone.

[CMD > /ipconfig /all] is the command prompt command to locate relavent information pertaining to 
your computer's identification, like your MAC Address

# Explain what a MAC address is and how it’s used in networking.

A MAC Address is the assigned identification to your physical device assigned during manufacturing. The first 3 segments
are associated to the manufacturer and the remainder 3 are by the vendor.

2. Router Brands

# Identify three popular router brands (e.g., Cisco, TP-Link, Netgear).

1. D-Link
2. Cisco
3. Huawei

#Discuss the features and differences between these brands.

1. Broadly known for commercial products, cost-effective, wide variety of products
2. A focus in enterprise markets with proprietary devices
3. Integrated cloud-based management, commerical products in telecommunication

3. Network Troubleshooting

# Describe three common network troubleshooting techniques (e.g., ping, traceroute,
ipconfig).

ping - you can ping the loopback address (127.0.0.1) to ensure your device to communicating with the local network.
traceroute - to track data packet routes and possible bottlenecks in the network.
ipconfig - you would use ipconfig commands like /release, /renew, /flushdns for various troubleshooting reasons. You may want
to reset the ip address assigned through DHCP if there is a discrepency in the assigned ip address and make a renew request.
OR /flushdns if there is a corruption in the DNS cache that is preventing you from accessing the network.

# Share a real-world scenario where you’d use each technique.
Only in school labs

4. Network Topologies

# Draw diagrams representing three network topologies: bus, star, and mesh.
# Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each topology.

# bus
advantages - wellknown device as it is older so troubleshooting issues is well documented. 
disadvantages - If the common cable fails then the whole network fails
# star 
advantages - Easy to setup, each node is connected to a switch/hub seperately which means if one node goes down 
the rest are still active, and it is easy to isolate and troubleshoot issues.
disadvantages - if the switch/hub goes down the whole network fails, and the performance is based of a single switch/hub.
# mesh
- advantages - easy to isolate and troubleshoot while maintaining performance uptime, data is reliably transferred as
it is transported through specific channels
- disadvantages - installation is complex and maintanence cost is high

5. Network Protocols

# Choose one network protocol (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP).
# Describe its purpose and provide an example of when it's used.

ftp - used in everyday office work to transfer, upload, and download files between workstations.
