Assignment 3

Start a multi-layer project that will end in April where you create a centralized platform for 
managing travel bookings, commissions, and supplier data. This system replaces paper and Excel-based
workflows with a secure, cloud-based solution that supports multi-agent access, dynamic commission tracking, 
and automated reporting. Key features include invoice management, customer and supplier tracking, and role-based 
permissions for agents and managers. Built for scalability, accuracy, and future integration 
with systems like SABRE and online booking tools.

In this Assignemnt folder you will find a Gnatt Chart (scheduling) and documentation throughout the projects development.
