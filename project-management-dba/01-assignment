### PROJECT INFORMATION:

Scope & WBS Exercise
Temporary Employment Agency (TEA) is a small employment agency that matches companies with a need for qualified temporary 
workers with individuals seeking temporary employment. They have 3 agents, a receptionist, and the owner/manager, and have 
been in business for a few years without having to develop a consistent system to store and retrieve information. 
They currently work with about 50 client companies, and each company typically works with one preferred agent. 
Each agent has his or her way of keeping track of the companies and their job openings: Access, Excel spreadsheets, or 
just notes.

They also do not have a good way of storing comprehensive data of the individual talent they placed in the past. 
A couple years ago there was an attempt to collect temporary workers data in one Access database, but after that agents 
would sometimes forget to update the information, so the records are not quite up to date.

Companies who need a temporary qualified worker provide a list of requirements for the position, like 
“3 years of Oracle DBA experience” or “Microsoft C# Certificate”. Some requirements are necessary, and some are optional. 
The agency first uses internal knowledge to identify potential candidates, and if they cannot find one, they post a job 
opening on various media. Then they create a short list of the candidates who best match the requirements and pass them 
over to the company.

With the current economic downturn, TEA is receiving a lot of inquiries from individuals with high qualifications who 
are seeking employment. They perceive this as a growth opportunity. They would like to develop a website that posts open 
positions from the client companies. Actually, they would like the companies to register themselves and use protected 
website to manage their own openings. The individuals seeking employment would browse the openings and respond to those 
that spark their interest. The agents would still interview the most promising candidates and send to the company just a 
few that best match the requirements.

The company currently operates on several HP laptops with Windows 10 operating system, and of course some network 
structure that provides a firewall and access to the Internet. They do not use any specialized software.

You were offered an opportunity to develop a database and a website for them. 

### ASSIGNMENT

# Temporary Employment Agency Database & Website Project. (TEADWP)
Tea is a Temporary Employment Agency that has been in business for a few years that is struggling to properly store and 
manage a database of talents looking for temporary employment with their list of client businesses who are looking for 
employees.

This project’s goal is to develop a database to properly store and filter talent submission for specific job postings 
that are found on a TEA’s client websites and be able to accurately recommend potential hires to their clients from a 
newly developed website.

Currently TEA does not have a reliable database storage method and with limited employees under their umbrella 
(3 agents, 1 receptionist, 1 owner) a fairly easy method of daily task executables and low maintenance options is 
needed to achieve their goal in a consistently accurate manner.

The project is aiming to implement a database with searchable metrics that pertain to job posting requirements, 
a consistent update of the database and backup recovery plan, and 3rd party website API integration. It will also 
consider possibility of scalable growth in both clientele and internal growth. 

The deliverables for this project will include: newly developed website, database schema, documentation procedures, 
server(s) (database/web hosting, data backup)

What will be included in this project will be a new website with API integration, index reporting for postings found 
on 3rd party websites (clients), and import and export features that support 
CSV, XLSX/XLS, TXT, XML, HTML, PDF, SYLK, LOG, login access and OAuth support for users, supportive documentation for 
users (including frequently asked questions and email support), database software, training documentation, 
hardware (server (database/web))

The project will not include features such as: files type import/export outside of scope (Access, Excel, Notepad), 
post-consultation after project completion (set date TBD), consultation with TEA clientele
 
The conditions that will be met to achieve a completed project will include:
 
Website
-	Communication with 3rd party websites (API access) and create data tables
-	Manage user queries (import/export files)

Database
-	Retrieve data from TEA’s website and store, update, and backup data.
-	Add and remove users, read/write access permissions, update permissions
 
Stakeholders:
-	TEA company and employees 
#	Responsibilities: TEA is our client company staff that matches other companies with a need for qualified temporary workers with individuals seeking temporary employment
-	TEA’s clients. 
#	Responsibilities: They will be interacting with the database as TEA’s client companies
-	Individual Job seekers 
#	Responsibilities: They will be interacting with the website to seek employers for hiring. 
Constraints for the project may include:
Time: Deadlines for project milestones, limited staff time
Resources: outdated hardware/software, lack of staff training if there are hardware/software upgrades, and the amount of employees available during live public service at project completion to properly manage resources
Budgets: Depending on hardware/software requirements, server uptime costs, user customer support requirements 
 
The assumptions we have as we begin this project are:
-	We have access to the data for implementation
-	We will have access to all resources required for the database development and implementation 
Risks:
-	Project deadlines could be missed due to delay or poor planning
-	Solution: Track your progress weekly to be able to adjust under any circumstances if a delay were to happen
-	Budget risks: the cost of the project could go beyond the initial budget that had been planned beforehand
-	Solution: Review costs regularly and get approvals before extra spending.
-	Resource: Lack of skilled employees/ not enough of employees which could lead to overwhelming /overload task
-	Solution: Provide the necessary training to the employees which then they could better understand the tasks
